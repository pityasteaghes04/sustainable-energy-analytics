# Sustainable Energy Analytics with Python

This project explores how solar panel energy output varies by location and device charging needs using Python data analysis. Built as a final project for a renewable energy course, it shows how different phone battery capacities and geographic sunlight data affect how many panels are needed to charge a device.

## What's Included

- `Sustainable Energy Analytics with Python.ipynb`: The main analysis notebook (coming soon!)
- `Sustainable_Energy_Analytics_Presentation.pptx`: Final presentation slides
- `requirements.txt`: Required Python packages

## Skills & Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Data visualization
- Renewable energy modeling

## Summary

- Compared phone charging needs using solar panel calculations
- Used Visual Crossing Weather API to analyze solar potential in locations like Eritrea and Seattle
- Built visualizations to determine how many panels are needed 90% of the year

## How to Run

Clone the repo and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pityasteaghes04/sustainable-energy-analytics.git
cd sustainable-energy-analytics
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
